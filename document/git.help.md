# Making Changes and Submitting to Git

1. Make changes to your local files in your working directory.

2. Stage the changes you want to commit using the `git add` command. For example, to stage all changes, you can use `git add .`.

    ```
    git add .
    ```

3. Commit the changes using the `git commit` command. For example, `git commit -m "Added new feature"`.

    ```
    git commit -m "Added new feature"
    ```

4. Push the changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command. For example, `git push origin main`.

    ```
    git push origin main
    ```
